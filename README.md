## Overview

This project explores industrial machine interaction and visualization using augmented reality (AR) to showcase the waste collection, treatment, and disposal process. Utilizing the Tilt 5 AR glasses and Unity, we built an immersive and interactive system that enables users to engage with and explore the operations of a factory environment. This project includes features for visualizing factory operations, manipulating industrial elements, and demonstrating workflows through intuitive interactions like rotating, moving, and scaling.

## Features

- **Tilt 5 SDK Setup**: Configured the Tilt 5 SDK and Unity development environment for seamless integration of AR functionalities.
- **Basic Interaction Functionalities**:  
  - Rotating, moving, and scaling objects within the factory environment.
  - Interaction with industrial machinery using the Tilt 5 wand controller and joystick for immersive control.
- **Factory Model Visualization**:  
  - Imported an industrial factory model into Unity to visualize and interact with waste collection and treatment systems.
- **Interactable Elements**:  
  - Enabled interactions with objects like waste carts and disposal units.
  - Layout rearrangement of elements in the environment for customized exploration.
- **Real-world Effects Simulation**:  
  - Added realistic effects such as smoke and ambient sounds to enhance the factory experience and simulate the real-world waste processing operations.
- **Workflow Demonstration**:  
  - Visualized the full waste collection and disposal workflow, helping users understand the process through an interactive experience.

## Setup Instructions

**Prerequisites**:  
   - Unity 2020.3 or higher  
   - Tilt 5 SDK installed  
   - Tilt 5 AR glasses  
   - The relevant project files.
